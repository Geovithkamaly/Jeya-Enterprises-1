            <p class="text-dark">We offer a highly versatile range of mineral Dolomite . The salient feature of our
                natural dolomite is its higher degree of purity, wet ability and whiteness. We use best quality machines
                to ensure the quality of our mineral dolomite. We have carved a niche as one of the leading dolomite
                manufacturers in India. Modern dolomite formation has been found to occur under anaerobic conditions in
                supersaturated saline lagoons along the Rio de Janeiro coast of Brazil, namely, Lagoa Vermelha and Brejo
                do Espinho. It is often thought that dolomite will develop only with the help of sulfate-reducing
                bacteria. However, low-temperature dolomite may occur in natural environments rich in organic matter and
                microbial cell surfaces. This occurs as a result of magnesium complexation by carboxyl groups associated
                with organic matter. Vast deposits of dolomite are present in the geological record, but the mineral is
                relatively rare in modern environments. Reproducible, inorganic low-temperature syntheses of dolomite
                and magnesite were published for the first time in 1999. Those laboratory experiments showed how the
                initial precipitation of a metastable "precursor" (such as magnesium calcite) will change gradually into
                more and more of the stable phase (such as dolomite or magnesite) during periodical intervals of
                dissolution and re-precipitation. The general principle governing the course of this irreversible
                geochemical reaction has been coined "breaking Ostwald's step rule".
                Dolomite is used as an ornamental stone, a concrete aggregate, and a source of magnesium oxide, as well
                as in the Pidgeon process for the production of magnesium. It is an important petroleum reservoir rock,
                and serves as the host rock for large strata-bound Mississippi Valley-Type or deposits of base metals
                such as lead, zinc, and copper. Where calcite limestone is uncommon or too costly, dolomite is sometimes
                used in its place as a flux for the smelting of iron and steel. Large quantities of processed dolomite
                are used in the production of float glass.
                In horticulture, dolomite and dolomitic limestone are added to soils and soilless potting mixes as a pH
                buffer and as a magnesium source.
                Dolomite is also used as the substrate in marine aquariums to help buffer changes in the pH of the
                water.
                Calcined dolomite is also used as a catalyst for destruction of tar in the gasification of biomass at
                high temperature. Particle physics researchers like to build particle detectors under layers of dolomite
                to enable the detectors to detect the highest possible number of exotic particles. Because dolomite
                contains relatively minor quantities of radioactive materials, it can insulate against interference from
                cosmic rays without adding to background radiation levels.
                In addition to being an industrial mineral, dolomite is highly valued by collectors and museums when it
                forms large, transparent crystals. The specimens that appear in the magnesite quarry exploited in Eugui,
                Esteribar, Navarra are considered among the best in the world.

                                        process of thermal decomposition into quick lime and carbon dioxide. It is
                                        frequently referred to as “calcinations.” Decomposition of limestone is
                                        characterized by very simple chemical reactions. Complexity is seen to arise
                                        when dealing with dolomite, which is believed to cause a change in
                                        crystallography and microstructure. Kinetics of decomposition of granular and
                                        lumped limestones has been found to be very complex. This has resulted in a
                                        limited validity to produce a unified theory on calcinations.</p>

                                    <p>Clay is a naturally occurring material found almost everywhere around the world.
                                        With the right treatment, it makes a perfect SCM and can be used to replace up
                                        to 40% of the clinker in your product. With our clay calciner system, you
                                        maximise your return on your investment. With lower capital costs as compared to
                                        a new clinker line, you get an energy efficient process that delivers a high
                                        quality product and can maximise your substitution rates. The process begins
                                        with the dryer crusher, designed specifically to manage the high moisture
                                        content of your clay. Material is then fed to the 2-stage preheater/calciner
                                        system where it is preheated and activated in the calciner. Our flash calciner
                                        system costs less to set up than a rotary kiln and is more energy efficient by
                                        approx.</p>

                                        this Calcium Carbonate Coated never deteriorates. Owing to the finest
                                        ingredients used in the best possible combination, the offered product has a
                                        longer shelf life and an impeccable effectiveness. Further, the product finds
                                        its application in the ISI Grade product where calcium as filler is used in low

                                        Calcium carbonate decomposes to form carbon dioxide and lime, an important
                                        material in making steel, glass, and paper. Because of its antacid properties,
                                        calcium carbonate is used in industrial settings to neutralize acidic conditions
                                        in both soil and water.
